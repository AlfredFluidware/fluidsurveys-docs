Responses
---------

The most important part of any FluidSurveys survey are the responses. Thankfully, we provide an intuitive Response Viewer, which is free for all accounts.
 
The Response Table is available via the [Analyze] > "Response" within the Editor, or [Analyze] > "Responses" via a survey in the Surveys Dashboard

The response viewer displays all of your survey responses in a tabular format. Each response is shown in an individual row, while the questions/answers are displayed in the columns.

Actions
^^^^^^^

Also, another option within the response table is the “Actions…” dropdown (located on the top and bottom) which allows for the deletion of all responses (as seen in Section 101).
Another option found in the “Actions” dropdown is the “Import responses” feature. The intent behind this option is to allow for a surveyor to easily upload responses they’ve garnered through an offline survey (pen and paper survey, survey created with FluidSurveys but printed and distributed locally, etc…).
When “Import Responses” is selected, you’ll be prompted to download a CSV template of your survey. You can then populate this template with the responses that were collected, and import it back into the system.
It’s also possible to add responses online. If you select “Add response” or “Add multiple responses”, blank entries will be added to your response database. You can then edit these and answer the questions on behalf of respondents.

Right-Click Menu
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A response table contains a tremendous amount of options. For instance, right clicking on a single response will produce a dropdown window with options to explicitly alter the state of that response.
Editing Response: Allow you to alter a user’s response
Delete Response: Delete the selected response
Change Response Status: You can change the status of a response to Incomplete, Complete, Terminated, or Quota Reached
Download Response:Download the response into a Adobe PDF format

Search
^^^^^^

Filter
^^^^^^

In the response viewer, you also have the ability to create filters and drill down into the data. Filters allow you to alter which responses are displayed. To create a filter, click on the plus sign at the top right of your screen, and you’ll be taken to the Filter Builder 

Selection Columns
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Make sure you specify the columns that you’d like to have included in the table before creating the filter. If they aren’t selected, they won’t appear in the table once the filter is applied.
To ensure that your responses are properly displayed, with or without a filter applied, select which column(s) you wish to appear. You can also “Select All” which will show every single column (response) within your survey.
In addition to simply providing responses, the responses table can show IP Addresses, GET Variables, Created Date, and so forth. To understand the response table in full detail, play around with it the next time you’re alone.

Pages
^^^^^

Note that some response tables can get very large. Luckily, there is a way to specify the amount of information shown on one page. To adjust the amount of responses you wish to display at once, or to move between response pages, adjust the values as seen below.
Selecting 10, 20, or 50 will display the respective amount of responses on that page.
