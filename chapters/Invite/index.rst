Invites
=======

FluidSurveys’ comes equipped with an invitation module through which survey links can be sent to potential respondents via email. Contacts can be added manually (one by one or in bulk) or imported directly from a third party address book. After the invitations are sent, the survey creator can keep track of who has received, viewed or completed the survey.

Survey invitations sent with the invitation module contain a customized message and a unique survey link through which the recipient can access the survey. The link includes a unique code that can identify the respondent and can be used by the respondent to re-gain entry and edit the survey, even after it has been submitted.

Reminders/History
-----------------



It can often be useful to send out reminders after your survey invitations have been sent. Perhaps individuals may have forgotten about the first email, or it got lost in an overcrowded inbox, etc. Reminders can give potential respondents the little nudge they need to provide you with some valuable feedback.

The process of sending reminders using FluidSurveys is fast and simple. First, from the left hand side toolbar, select the “Reminders/History” button. 

On this screen, you’ll see a history of all of the survey invitations and reminders that you’ve sent out.

Clicking “Review” will show you what was written in the message, to who it was sent and the status of each contact (whether they’ve completed the survey or viewed/ not viewed the 
survey invite). To compose a reminder, click the “Compose Reminder” link.

You’ll then be able to enter your reminder message and specify to who the reminder should be sent. To do so, click on “Advanced Options”, and you’ll be able to select whether you want it sent to everyone, only to those who’ve viewed the invite, only the ones who haven’t viewed the invite, etc. Once you’ve inputted your settings, click on the “Send eminders” button and your reminder email will be sent out.



Address Book
------------



If you have a large collection of contacts that you’d like to invite to take your survey, it might not be feasible to add them individually. In this case, you could bulk import contacts from an .XLS or .CSV file. Address book programs (Outlook, Gmail, Lotus, etc) typically allow you to export contact lists directly into .CSV or .XLS, so you can either use these programs or create your own file.

Once you’ve created your .CSV or .XLS file, select the “Import Contacts” button under the “Individuals to Invite” label. A pop-up will appear prompting you to select your file from your computer and upload it to FluidSurveys.com.

Once you’ve uploaded your contacts, they’ll appear in the summary box

**Custom Variables**

Custom variables allow for additional information to be uploaded with contacts, and these can then be viewed alongside their responses


.. note:: 

	In order for your contacts to upload properly with custom fields, the file has to contain the two columns: “Name” and “Email”, in addition to the Custom Fields, which do not need to follow any specific order.

Tools

It is sometimes appropriate to restrict access to your survey so only select individuals have access to it. A perfect way to do this is with invite codes.

Invite codes can be distributed in two ways. If the FluidSurveys’ invitation module is used, the invite code will automatically be appended to the invite link in the email and no work on the part of the respondent is required.

If the invitation module is not used, the survey creator can manually generate the invite codes for their survey (as many as necessary). They would then have to provide a unique code for each potential respondent as access to the survey would not be granted without a code.

Lists

Another option when sending out invites is to create and use lists. Lists are very useful as they can store and organize contacts in your account, and can be used to invite respondents to multiple surveys.
