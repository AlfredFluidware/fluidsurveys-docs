Creating Surveys
----------------


Multi-language Surveys
----------------------

How it works

The survey language option essentially changes the default messages provided by FluidSurveys. When that specific langauge is applied, we provided translated default messages for the following areas:

.. admonition:: Translated Sections
	
	1. Navitation Buttons
	2. Yes/No Question Type
	3. Validation error messages





**Note:** adding a language does not automatically transate the survey design, ie., questions and answers into another language.


Import from Survey Monkey
