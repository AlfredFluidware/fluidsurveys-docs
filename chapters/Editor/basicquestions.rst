Basic Questions
---------------

The complete set of question types are available to Enterprise customers.



Section Heading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Section Separators allow survey creators to include text within their survey without actually asking a question. It can be used to include an introduction or some explanatory text in your survey, pictures, endnotes, etc. If ever you simply need to convey a message without explicitly asking a question, then a Section Separator can satisfy such a role.
It should be noted that, despite being able to provide a Section Separator with a unique identifier, you cannot attach logic branching rules to the question type.

A Section Separator does not explicitly need to only convey a brief message about a section, or how to complete a task, but can be used implicitly to provide a look and feel for your survey unparalleled by any question type. 


Yes/No
^^^^^^

A Yes/No question type is the simplest question type that we have. It has a default scoring mechanism of 1 (Yes) and 2 (No), and the choices are translated to their appropriate language when multiple languages resides on a survey. Yes/No questions are perfect when you need quick and easy page skipping based on the response.

Including multiple languages on your survey will automatically include the appropriate translation for “Yes/No”. Therefore, Yes/No questions by default become perfect tools as “Do you agree?” pivot questions. 

Text Response
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A Text Response question type allows for surveyors to ask a user to type either the answer out, or provide specific textual information (phone number, address, etc…). Text Response questions come with text validation ranging from Email addresses, Currency, all the way to Percentages.

Enabling the Multiline option and indicating the number of columns can create the perfect storm for allowing users to fill in text, which can also be restricted to a certain amount of words. The example below has a Text Response question type with multiline enabled, 50 columns, and All Characters validation of 2000 (roughly 200 words) which will cease to accept words after that point.

Checkbox
^^^^^^^^

The checkbox question type is a multi-answer question, as in you can select more than one answer. Checkbox choice can contain a text response (which can have Validation) beside each choice, as well as an “Other, Please Specify” option which is an exclusive choice (Selecting it, or typing into the text area, will automatically deselect all options and select the other). 

Multiple Choice
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Multiple choice question type, commonly referred to as the single choice question type, allows for a user to provide one answer per question, whereas a checkbox question type allows for the user to specify more than one answer. Each choice has branching, skipping, and validation capabilities available. The display options are slightly different, in that you can change the views (Horizontal, Vertical, Combo box, Star Rating – see blow –). Star Ratings, generally used for a rating between 1 and an end value, allow for the rating to exist on a horizontal star level. 


Dropdown
^^^^^^^^

The dropdown question type is exactly what the name entails; an answer found and selected in a dropdown fashion. Also, similarly to a multiple choice question, the dropdown question type allows for only one answer. 

Date/Time
^^^^^^^^^

A Date/Time question allows for the user to select a specific year, month, day as seen below. Date/Time questions are perfect when either trying to determine when an incident happened, or even when finding the perfect time to have a meeting. The question type essentially allows for a user to record the date and time with five types of configurations; Date/Time, Date Only, Time Only, Date/Month, and Month/Year.

Below are the 5 customizable forms of the date/time question type
Form 1: Date/Time
Will accept both the date (YYYY-MM-DD) and time (Non-Military standard time)
Form 2: Date Only
Will accept only the date (YYYY-MM-DD)
Form 3: Time Only
Will accept only the time (Non-Military standard time)
Form 4: Date/Month
Will accept only the date (YYYY-MM-DD) and month
Form 5: Month/Year
Will accept only the month and year


FYI 140.2 Despite not accepting military standard time, if the user enters 21:00, the question type will convert it to 9:00 pm


Text Response Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


In short, a Text Response Grid allows for the surveyor to ask a series of question with a set of validation types applied (Numerical, Text only, All Characters, etc…) which will present an error to the user if the validation was not adhered to. 
Below is a screenshot of how the text response grid looks by default. To adjust the fields to your personal preference, see the section below on the available display options. 




Multiple Choice Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^


The Multiple Choice Grid question type is in essence a Likert question. This question type heralds in a new option, make column static, which will keep the most left column (with all the variables in question) static as you drag the scrollbar to the right. 


Dropdown Grid
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Dropdown Grid is similar to its sibling, the dropdown question, in that it is still similar to a multiple choice question, with a single answer only. This  is the direct opposite of a checkbox question, which can have many answers.
